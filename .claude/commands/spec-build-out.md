# Spec Build Out

I (Till) drafted some idea that I want to implement. Please help me to build it out to a specification. Let's go thru some iterations together, working on the spec markdown document.

Please read thru the spec document, and add your thoughts:

- Architecture: What thoughts do you have? What options? What are the pros and cons of each?
- UI: What thoughts do you have? What options? What are the pros and cons of each approach?

Are there functional gaps? 

Please keep the document short! Add code snippets only if they are REALLY key!!
