# Spec iterate

I added my thoughts, decisions and comments to the specs. They are tagged with "->". Please read them and rework the document:

- Compile the ideas to one coherent flow
- Delete the options we rejected 
- Review the entire document, make sure it is easy to read and understandable. 

Please keep the document short! Add code snippets only if they are REALLY key!!
